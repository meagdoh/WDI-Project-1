**Introduction**

Flashcards are an effective way to share and teach new information to students, professionals - basically anyone. Technology lexicon can be highly determined depending on where you are in the world. A group focused on bridging the gaps and best practices for international technology projects is a collective called ICTworks.

ICTworks focuses on the use of information and communication technologies (ICT) and the implementation processes that can make them sustainable in rural and underserved communities across the developing world (ICT4D). Recently, ICTworks published a Digital Development Glossary on their blog with a list of 30 widely accepted definitions in the ICT in development space. Consumers of this glossary are primarily students, researchers, politicians, and technologists.

**User Stories**

_International Development (ID) Student_ - Anyone studying international development in 2017 will encounter ICT as a concept. From an academic perspective, students are motivated to learn best practices and shared terms to better understand what’s going on “in the field.”

+ Interests: ID theory
+ Goals: Building a toolkit of knowledge for future career.
+ Motivations: Intrinsic motivation to understand new concepts and ideas.

_ID Researcher_ - Research professionals in the field of international development are continuously iterating on outcomes-driven solutions. In addition to the proven methodologies in M&E, a shared lexicon is important to the ID researcher.

+ Interests: Field work, continuous improvement of programs.
+ Goals: Contributing to shared knowledge base.
+ Motivations: Intrinsic motivation to share new concepts and ideas.

_Government Officials_ - Individuals and groups in public office are always looking to better understand the effectiveness of local projects. To better understand their community, it is important for them to have a shared language with ID professionals. Often times, miscommunication can lead to negative program outcomes and will set back a developing nation with limited resources.

+ Interests: The livelihood of their constituents. Effective government programs.
+ Goals: Sharing a common language with on-the-ground workers.
+ Motivations: Intrinsic motivation to understand the high-level concepts

_Local Citizens_ - Those living in developing countries are increasingly exposed to new technologies and deployment strategies. Often times, ID NGOs partner with local residents to conduct interviews and focus groups. As the presence of technology increases, it will be important to citizens to engage with theses terms.

+ Interests: Improving livelihood
+ Goals: Building and strengthening community-level development programs.
+ Motivations: To provide effective feedback on programs
